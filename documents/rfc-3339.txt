1.  Introduction

   Dates and times are used in a very diverse set of internet
   applications, all the way from server-side logging to calendaring and
   scheduling.

   Each distinct instant in time can be represented in a descriptive
   text format using a timestamp, and [ISO8601] standardizes a widely-
   adopted timestamp format, which forms the basis of [RFC3339].
   However, this format doesn't allow timestamps to contain any
   additional relevant information, which means that any contextual
   information related to a given timestamp needs to be either handled
   separately or attached to it in a non-standard manner.

   This is already a pressing issue for applications that handle each
   instant with an associated time zone name, to take into account
   things like DST transitions.  Most of these applications attach the
   timezone to the timestamp in a non-standard format, atleast one of
   which is fairly well-adopted.  Furthermore, applications might want
   to attach even more information to the timestamp, including but not
   limited to the calendar system it must be represented in.

   This document seeks to standardize an extension syntax for timestamps
   as specified in [RFC3339] that has the following properties:

   *  The extension suffix should be completely optional, making
      existing [RFC3339] timestamps compatible with this format.

   *  The format should be compatible to the pre-existing popular syntax
      for attaching time zone names to timestamps.

   *  The format should allow a generalized way to attach any additional
      information to the timestamp.

2.  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   UTC  Coordinated Universal Time as maintained since 1988 by the
      Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) in conjunction
      with leap seconds as announced by the International Earth Rotation
      and Reference Frames Service [IERS].  From 1972 through 1987 UTC
      was maintained entirely by Bureau International de l'Heure (BIH).
      Before 1972 UTC was not generally recognized and civil time was
      determined by individual jurisdictions using different techniques
      for attempting to follow Universal Time based on measuring the
      rotation of the earth.

   second  The unit of time in the International System of Units.  Since
      Resolution 1 of the 13th CGPM on 1967-10-13 [CGPM] the second is
      defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 cycles of microwave
      radiation absorbed or emitted by the hyperfine transition of
      cesium-133 atoms in their ground state undisturbed by external
      fields, but this definition was not in practical use for civil
      time until 1972-01-01.  Prior to 1972-01-01 civil time was based
      on Universal Time which was measured by observations of the
      rotation of the earth, and the practical definition of the second
      was 1/86400 of the mean solar day.

   minute  A period of time of 60 seconds.  However, see also the
      restrictions in section Section 4.9 and Appendix C for how leap
      seconds are denoted within minutes.

   hour  A period of time of 60 minutes.

      time scale.  In other contexts the duration of one mean solar day
      as agreed internationally by the 1884 International Meridian
      Conference and measured using Universal Time.

   leap year  In the proleptic Gregorian calendar, a year which has 366
      days.  A leap year is a year whose number is divisible by four an
      integral number of times, except that if it is a centennial year
      (i.e. divisible by one hundred) it shall also be divisible by four
      hundred an integral number of times.

   ABNF  Augmented Backus-Naur Form, a format used to represent
      permissible strings in a protocol or language, as defined in
      [RFC2234].

   Email Date/Time Format  The date/time format used by Internet Mail as
      defined by [RFC2822].

   Internet Date/Time Format  The date/time format defined in section 5
      of this document.

   Timestamp  This term is used in this document to refer to an
      unambiguous representation of some instant in time.

   Z  A suffix which, when applied to a time, denotes a UTC offset of
      00:00; often spoken "Zulu" from the ICAO phonetic alphabet
      representation of the letter "Z".

   Time Zone  A time zone that is a included in the Time Zone Database
      (often called "tz" or "zoneinfo") maintained by IANA.

   For more information about time scales, see Appendix E of [RFC1305],
   Section 3 of [ISO8601], and the appropriate ITU documents [ITU-R-TF].

3.  Local Time

3.1.  Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)

   Because the daylight saving rules for local time zones are so
   convoluted and can change based on local law at unpredictable times,
   true interoperability is best achieved by using Coordinated Universal
   Time (UTC).  This specification by itself does not cater to local
   time zone rules.  However, certain implementations may be expected
   to.  For these situations, a timestamp may additionally include a
   local time zone that the implementations can take into account.

3.2.  Local Offsets

   The offset between local time and UTC is often useful information.
   For example, in electronic mail (RFC2822, [RFC2822]) the local offset
   provides a useful heuristic to determine the probability of a prompt
   response.  Attempts to label local offsets with alphabetic strings
   have resulted in poor interoperability in the past [RFC1123].  As a
   result, RFC2822 [RFC2822] has made numeric offsets mandatory.

   Numeric offsets are calculated as "local time minus UTC".  So the
   equivalent time in UTC can be determined by subtracting the offset
   from the local time.  For example, "18:50:00-04:00" is the same time
   as "22:50:00Z".  (This example shows negative offsets handled by
   adding the absolute value of the offset.)

   Numeric offsets may differ from UTC by any number of seconds, or even
   a fraction of seconds.  This can be easily represented by including
   an optional seconds value in the offset, which may further optionally
   include a fraction of seconds behind a decimal point, for example
   "+12:34:56.789".  This is especially useful in the case of certain
   historical time zones.

3.3.  Unknown Local Offset Convention

   If the time in UTC is known, but the offset to local time is unknown,
   this can be represented with an offset of "-00:00".  This differs
   semantically from an offset of "Z" or "+00:00", which imply that UTC
   is the preferred reference point for the specified time.  RFC2822
   [RFC2822] describes a similar convention for email.

3.4.  Unqualified Local Time

   A number of devices currently connected to the Internet run their
   internal clocks in local time and are unaware of UTC.  While the
   Internet does have a tradition of accepting reality when creating
   specifications, this should not be done at the expense of
   interoperability.  Since interpretation of an unqualified local time
   zone will fail in approximately 23/24 of the globe, the
   interoperability problems of unqualified local time are deemed
   unacceptable for the Internet.  Systems that are configured with a
   local time, are unaware of the corresponding UTC offset, and depend
   on time synchronization with other Internet systems, MUST use a
   mechanism that ensures correct synchronization with UTC.  Some
   suitable mechanisms are:

   *  Use Network Time Protocol [RFC1305] to obtain the time in UTC.

Internet-Draft             Timestamps Extended                 June 2021


   *  Use another host in the same local time zone as a gateway to the
      Internet.  This host MUST correct unqualified local times that are
      transmitted to other hosts.

   *  Prompt the user for the local time zone and daylight saving rule
      settings.

4.  Date and Time format

   This section discusses desirable qualities of date and time formats
   and defines a format that extends the profile of ISO 8601 for use in
   Internet protocols.

4.1.  Ordering

   If date and time components are ordered from least precise to most
   precise, then a useful property is achieved.  Assuming that the time
   zones of the dates and times are the same (e.g., all in UTC),
   expressed using the same string (e.g., all "Z" or all "+00:00"), all
   times have the same number of fractional second digits, and they all
   have the same suffix (or none), then the date and time strings may be
   sorted as strings (e.g., using the "strcmp()" function in C) and a
   time-ordered sequence will result.  The presence of optional
   punctuation would violate this characteristic.

4.2.  Human Readability

   Human readability has proved to be a valuable feature of Internet
   protocols.  Human readable protocols greatly reduce the costs of
   debugging since telnet often suffices as a test client and network
   analyzers need not be modified with knowledge of the protocol.  On
   the other hand, human readability sometimes results in
   interoperability problems.  For example, the date format "10/11/1996"
   is completely unsuitable for global interchange because it is
   interpreted differently in different countries.  In addition, the
   date format in (RFC822) has resulted in interoperability problems
   when people assumed any text string was permitted and translated the
   three letter abbreviations to other languages or substituted date
   formats which were easier to generate (e.g. the format used by the C
   function "ctime").  For this reason, a balance must be struck between
   human readability and interoperability.

   Because no date and time format is readable according to the
   conventions of all countries, Internet clients SHOULD be prepared to
   transform dates into a display format suitable for the locality.
   This may include translating UTC to local time as well as converting
   from the Gregorian calendar to the viewer's preferred calendar.

Internet-Draft             Timestamps Extended                 June 2021


4.3.  Rarely Used Options

   A format which includes rarely used options is likely to cause
   interoperability problems.  This is because rarely used options are
   less likely to be used in alpha or beta testing, so bugs in parsing
   are less likely to be discovered.  Rarely used options should be made
   mandatory or omitted for the sake of interoperability whenever
   possible.

4.4.  Redundant Information

   If a date/time format includes redundant information, that introduces
   the possibility that the redundant information will not correlate.
   For example, including the day of the week in a date/time format
   introduces the possibility that the day of week is incorrect but the
   date is correct, or vice versa.  Since it is not difficult to compute
   the day of week from a date (see Appendix A), the day of week should
   not be included in a date/time format.

4.5.  Simplicity

   The complete set of date and time formats specified in ISO 8601
   [ISO8601] is quite complex in an attempt to provide multiple
   representations and partial representations.  Internet protocols have
   somewhat different requirements and simplicity has proved to be an
   important characteristic.  In addition, Internet protocols usually
   need complete specification of data in order to achieve true
   interoperability.  Therefore, the complete grammar for ISO 8601 is
   deemed too complex for most Internet protocols.

   The following section defines a format that in an extension of a
   profile of ISO 8601 for use on the Internet.  It is a conformant
   subset of the ISO 8601 extended format with additional information
   optionally suffixed.  Simplicity is achieved by making most fields
   and punctuation mandatory.

4.6.  Informative

   The format should allow implementations to specify additional
   important information in addition to the bare timestamp.  This is
   done by allowing implementations to include an informative suffix at
   the end with as many tags as required, each with a key and value
   separated by an equals sign.  The value can be a hyphen delimited
   list of multiple values.

   In case a key is repeated or conflicted, the implementations should
   give precedence to whichever value is positioned first.

Internet-Draft             Timestamps Extended                 June 2021


4.7.  Namespaced

   Since the suffix can include all sorts of additional information,
   different standards bodies/organizations need a way to identify which
   part adheres to their standards.  For this, all information needs to
   be namespaced.  Each key is therefore divided into two hyphen-
   separated sections: the namespace and the key.  For example, the
   calendar as defined by the Unicode consortium could be included as
   "u-ca=<value>".

   All single-character namespaces are reserved for BCP47 extensions
   recorded in the BCP47 extensions registry.  For these namespaces:

   *  Case differences are ignored.

   *  The namespace is restricted to single alphanum, corresponding to
      extension singletons ('x' can be used for a private use
      extension).

   *  In addition, for CLDR extensions:

      -  There must be a "namespace-key" and it is restricted to 2
         "alphanum" characters.

      -  A "suffix-value" is limited to "3*8alphanum".

   Multi-character namespaces can be registered specifically for use in
   this format.  They are assigned by IANA using the "IETF Review"
   policy defined by [RFC5226].  This policy requires the development of
   an RFC, which SHALL define the name, purpose, processes, and
   procedures for maintaining the subtags.  The maintaining or
   registering authority, including name, contact email, discussion list
   email, and URL location of the registry, MUST be indicated clearly in
   the RFC.  The RFC MUST specify or include each of the following:

   *  The specification MUST reference the specific version or revision
      of this document that governs its creation and MUST reference this
      section of this document.

   *  The specification and all keys defined by the specification MUST
      follow the ABNF and other rules for the formation of keys as
      defined in this document.  In particular, it MUST specify that
      case is not significant and that keys MUST NOT exceed eight
      characters in length.

   *  The specification MUST specify a canonical representation.

Internet-Draft             Timestamps Extended                 June 2021


   *  The specification of valid keys MUST be available over the
      Internet and at no cost.

   *  The specification MUST be in the public domain or available via a
      royalty-free license acceptable to the IETF and specified in the
      RFC.

   *  The specification MUST be versioned, and each version of the
      specification MUST be numbered, dated, and stable.

   *  The specification MUST be stable.  That is, namespace keys, once
      defined by a specification, MUST NOT be retracted or change in
      meaning in any substantial way.

   *  The specification MUST include, in a separate section, the
      registration form reproduced in this section (below) to be used in
      registering the namespace upon publication as an RFC.

   *  IANA MUST be informed of changes to the contact information and
      URL for the specification.

   IANA will maintain a registry of allocated multi-character
   namespaces.  This registry MUST use the record-jar format described
   by the ABNF in [RFC5646].  Upon publication of a namespace as an RFC,
   the maintaining authority defined in the RFC MUST forward this
   registration form to <mailto:iesg@ietf.org>, who MUST forward the
   request to <mailto:iana@iana.org>.  The maintaining authority of the
   namespace MUST maintain the accuracy of the record by sending an
   updated full copy of the record to <mailto:iana@iana.org> with the
   subject line "TIMESTAMP FORMAT NAMESPACE UPDATE" whenever content
   changes.  Only the 'Comments', 'Contact_Email', 'Mailing_List', and
   'URL' fields MAY be modified in these updates.

   Failure to maintain this record, maintain the corresponding registry,
   or meet other conditions imposed by this section of this document MAY
   be appealed to the IESG [RFC2028] under the same rules as other IETF
   decisions (see [RFC2026]) and MAY result in the authority to maintain
   the extension being withdrawn or reassigned by the IESG.

   SHOULD specify which sequence to use, although the IESG MAY change
   the assignment when approving the RFC.

   'Description' contains the name and description of the namespace.

   'Comments' is an OPTIONAL field and MAY contain a broader description
   of the namespace.

   'Added' contains the date the namespace's RFC was published in the
   "date-full" format specified in Figure 2.  For example: 2004-06-28
   represents June 28, 2004, in the Gregorian calendar.

4.9.  Restrictions

   The grammar element date-mday represents the day number within the
   current month.  The maximum value varies based on the month and year
   as follows:

   The grammar element time-second may have the value "60" at the end of
   months in which a leap second occurs - to date: June (XXXX-
   06-30T23:59:60Z) or December (XXXX-12-31T23:59:60Z); see Appendix C
   for a table of leap seconds.  It is also possible for a leap second
   to be subtracted, at which times the maximum value of time-second is
   "58".  At all other times the maximum value of time-second is "59".
   Further, in time zones other than "Z", the leap second point is
   shifted by the zone offset (so it happens at the same instant around
   the globe).

   Leap seconds cannot be predicted far into the future.  The
   International Earth Rotation Service publishes bulletins (IERS) that
   announce leap seconds with a few weeks' warning.  Applications should
   not generate timestamps involving inserted leap seconds until after
   the leap seconds are announced.

   The maximum value of a time-second grammar element inside a time-
   offset grammar element is always "59".

   Although ISO 8601 permits the hour to be "24", this extension of a
   profile of ISO 8601 only allows values between "00" and "23" for the
   hour in order to reduce confusion.

4.10.  Examples

   Here are some examples of Internet date/time format.

   1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z

                                  Figure 3

   This represents 20 minutes and 50.52 seconds after the 23rd hour of
   April 12th, 1985 in UTC.

                                  Figure 4

   This represents the same instant as the previous example but with the
   expanded 6-digit year format.

   1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00

                                  Figure 5

   This represents 39 minutes and 57 seconds after the 16th hour of
   December 19th, 1996 with an offset of -08:00 from UTC.  Note that
   this is equivalent to 1996-12-20T00:39:57Z in UTC.

                                  Figure 6

   This represents the exact same instant as the previous example but
   additionally specifies the human time zone associated with it
   ("Pacific Time") for time-zone-aware implementations to take into
   account.

   1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00[America/Los_Angeles][u-ca=hebrew]

                                  Figure 7

   This represents the exact same instant but it informs calendar-aware
   implementations that they should project it to the Hebrew calendar.

   1990-12-31T23:59:60Z

                                  Figure 8

   This represents the leap second inserted at the end of 1990.

   1990-12-31T15:59:60-08:00

                                  Figure 9

   This represents the same leap second in Pacific Standard Time, 8
   hours behind UTC.

   1937-01-01T12:00:27.87+00:19:32.130

                                 Figure 10

   This represents the same instant of time as noon, January 1, 1937,
   Netherlands time.  Standard time in the Netherlands was exactly 19
   minutes and 32.13 seconds ahead of UTC by law from 1909-05-01 through
   1937-06-30.

   Since there's not a single agreed-upon way to deal with dates in the
   Islamic calendar, it provides another value to disambiguate between
   the different interpretations.

   This timestamp utilizes the private use namespace to declare two
   additional pieces of information in the suffix that can be
   interpreted by any compatible implementations and ignored otherwise.

Appendix C.  Leap Seconds

   In 1970 CCIR Recommendation 460 produced international agreement that
   starting on 1972-01-01 radio broadcast time signals should provide SI
   seconds with occasional leaps of 1 SI second as necessary to agree
   with Universal Time.  The time scale in radio broadcasts became known
   as UTC, and the current version of that recommendation is [ITU-R-TF].
   Since 1988 IERS has the responsibility for announcing when leap
   seconds will be introduced into UTC
   (https://www.iers.org/SharedDocs/Publikationen/EN/IERS/Documents/
   IERS_Leap_Seconds.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1).  Further

   information about leap seconds can be found at the US Navy
   Oceanography Portal (https://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/time/master-
   clock/leap-seconds).  In particular, it notes that:

   |  The decision to introduce a leap second in UTC is the
   |  responsibility of the International Earth Rotation Service [IERS].
   |  According to the CCIR Recommendation, first preference is given to
   |  the opportunities at the end of December and June, and second
   |  preference to those at the end of March and September.

   When required, insertion of a leap second occurs as an extra second
   at the end of a day in UTC, represented by a timestamp of the form
   YYYY-MM-DDT23:59:60Z.  A leap second occurs simultaneously in all
   time zones, so that time zone relationships are not affected.  See
   section Section 4.10 for some examples of leap second times.

   The following table is an excerpt from the table maintained by the
   IERS.  The source data are located at the Earth Orientation
   Parameters Product Centre at Observatoire de Paris
   (https://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/index.php?index=TAI-UTC_tab&lang=en).

   For dates after the initial adjustment on 1972-01-01 this table shows
   the date of the leap second, and the difference between the time
   scale TAI (which is not adjusted by leap seconds) and UTC after that
   leap second.
