== Date and Time format

This section discusses desirable qualities of date and time formats
and defines a format that extends the profile of ISO 8601 for use in
Internet protocols.

=== Ordering

If date and time components are ordered from least precise to most
precise, then a useful property is achieved. Assuming that the time
zones of the dates and times are the same (e.g., all in UTC),
expressed using the same string (e.g., all "Z" or all "+00:00"), all
times have the same number of fractional second digits, and they all
have the same suffix (or none), then the date and time strings may be
sorted as strings (e.g., using the `strcmp()` function in C) and a
time-ordered sequence will result. The presence of optional punctuation
would violate this characteristic.

=== Human Readability

Human readability has proved to be a valuable feature of Internet
protocols. Human readable protocols greatly reduce the costs of
debugging since telnet often suffices as a test client and network
analyzers need not be modified with knowledge of the protocol. On
the other hand, human readability sometimes results in
interoperability problems. For example, the date format "10/11/1996"
is completely unsuitable for global interchange because it is
interpreted differently in different countries. In addition, the
date format in (RFC822) has resulted in interoperability problems when
people assumed any text string was permitted and translated the three
letter abbreviations to other languages or substituted date formats
which were easier to generate (e.g. the format used by the C function
`ctime`). For this reason, a balance must be struck between human
readability and interoperability.

Because no date and time format is readable according to the
conventions of all countries, Internet clients SHOULD be prepared to
transform dates into a display format suitable for the locality.
This may include translating UTC to local time as well as converting
from the Gregorian calendar to the viewer's preferred calendar.

=== Rarely Used Options

A format which includes rarely used options is likely to cause
interoperability problems. This is because rarely used options are
less likely to be used in alpha or beta testing, so bugs in parsing
are less likely to be discovered. Rarely used options should be made
mandatory or omitted for the sake of interoperability whenever
possible.

// The format defined below includes only one rarely used option:
// fractions of a second. It is expected that this will be used only by
// applications which require strict ordering of date/time stamps or
// which have an unusual precision requirement.

// NOTE: does this apply any longer?

=== Redundant Information

If a date/time format includes redundant information, that introduces
the possibility that the redundant information will not correlate.
For example, including the day of the week in a date/time format
introduces the possibility that the day of week is incorrect but the
date is correct, or vice versa. Since it is not difficult to compute
the day of week from a date (see <<annexA>>), the day of week should
not be included in a date/time format.

=== Simplicity

// <<annexA>> contains an attempt to translate the complete syntax of ISO
// 8601 into <<RFC2234>>.

The complete set of date and time formats specified in ISO 8601
<<ISO8601>> is quite complex in an attempt to provide multiple
representations and partial representations. Internet protocols have
somewhat different requirements and simplicity has proved to be an
important characteristic. In addition, Internet protocols usually need
complete specification of data in order to achieve true interoperability.
Therefore, the complete grammar for ISO 8601 is deemed too complex for
most Internet protocols.

The following section defines a format that in an extension of a profile
of ISO 8601 for use on the Internet. It is a conformant subset of the ISO
8601 extended format with additional information optionally suffixed.
Simplicity is achieved by making most fields and punctuation mandatory.

=== Informative

The format should allow implementations to specify additional important
information in addition to the bare timestamp. This is done by allowing
implementations to include an informative suffix at the end with as many
tags as required, each with a key and value separated by an equals sign.
The value can be a hyphen delimited list of multiple values.

In case a key is repeated or conflicted, the implementations should give
precedence to whichever value is positioned first.

=== Namespaced

Since the suffix can include all sorts of additional information,
different standards bodies/organizations need a way to identify which part
adheres to their standards. For this, all information needs to be
namespaced. Each key is therefore divided into two hyphen-separated
sections: the namespace and the key. For example, the calendar as defined
by the Unicode consortium could be included as `u-ca=<value>`.

All single-character namespaces are reserved for BCP47 extensions recorded
in the BCP47 extensions registry. For these namespaces:

* Case differences are ignored.

* The namespace is restricted to single alphanum, corresponding to
extension singletons ('x' can be used for a private use extension).

* In addition, for CLDR extensions:
** There must be a `namespace-key` and it is restricted to 2 `alphanum`
characters.
** A `suffix-value` is limited to `3*8alphanum`.

Multi-character namespaces can be registered specifically for use in this
format. They are assigned by IANA using the "IETF Review" policy defined
by [RFC5226]. This policy requires the development of an RFC, which SHALL
define the name, purpose, processes, and procedures for maintaining the
subtags. The maintaining or registering authority, including name, contact
email, discussion list email, and URL location of the registry, MUST be
indicated clearly in the RFC. The RFC MUST specify or include each of the
following:

* The specification MUST reference the specific version or revision of
this document that governs its creation and MUST reference this section of
this document.

* The specification and all keys defined by the specification MUST
follow the ABNF and other rules for the formation of keys as defined in
this document. In particular, it MUST specify that case is not significant
and that keys MUST NOT exceed eight characters in length.

* The specification MUST specify a canonical representation.

* The specification of valid keys MUST be available over the Internet
and at no cost.

* The specification MUST be in the public domain or available via a
royalty-free license acceptable to the IETF and specified in the RFC.

* The specification MUST be versioned, and each version of the
specification MUST be numbered, dated, and stable.

* The specification MUST be stable. That is, namespace keys, once defined
by a specification, MUST NOT be retracted or change in meaning in any
substantial way.

* The specification MUST include, in a separate section, the registration
form reproduced in this section (below) to be used in registering the
namespace upon publication as an RFC.

* IANA MUST be informed of changes to the contact information and URL for
the specification.

IANA will maintain a registry of allocated multi-character namespaces. This
registry MUST use the record-jar format described by the ABNF in <<RFC5646,section=3.1.1>>.
Upon publication of a namespace as an RFC, the maintaining
authority defined in the RFC MUST forward this registration form to
<iesg@ietf.org>, who MUST forward the request to <iana@iana.org>. The
maintaining authority of the namespace MUST maintain the accuracy of the
record by sending an updated full copy of the record to <iana@iana.org>
with the subject line "TIMESTAMP FORMAT NAMESPACE UPDATE" whenever content
changes. Only the 'Comments', 'Contact_Email', 'Mailing_List', and 'URL'
fields MAY be modified in these updates.

Failure to maintain this record, maintain the corresponding registry,
or meet other conditions imposed by this section of this document MAY
be appealed to the IESG <<RFC2028>> under the same rules as other IETF
decisions (see <<RFC2026>>) and MAY result in the authority to maintain
the extension being withdrawn or reassigned by the IESG.

.Format of Records in the Timestamp Format Namespace Registry
[source]
----
%%
Identifier:
Description:
Comments:
Added:
RFC:
Authority:
Contact_Email:
Mailing_List:

%%
----

'Identifier' contains the multi-character sequence assigned to the
namespace. The Internet-Draft submitted to define the namespace SHOULD
specify which sequence to use, although the IESG MAY change the assignment
when approving the RFC.

'Description' contains the name and description of the namespace.

'Comments' is an OPTIONAL field and MAY contain a broader description
of the namespace.

'Added' contains the date the namespace's RFC was published in the
"date-full" format specified in <<grammar>>.  For example: 2004-06-28
represents June 28, 2004, in the Gregorian calendar.

'RFC' contains the RFC number assigned to the namespace.

'Authority' contains the name of the maintaining authority for the
namespace.

'Contact_Email' contains the email address used to contact the
maintaining authority.

'Mailing_List' contains the URL or subscription email address of the
mailing list used by the maintaining authority.

'URL' contains the URL of the registry for this namespace.

The determination of whether an Internet-Draft meets the above
conditions and the decision to grant or withhold such authority rests
solely with the IESG and is subject to the normal review and appeals
process associated with the RFC process.

=== Internet Date/Time Format

The following extension of a profile of <<ISO8601>> dates SHOULD be
used in new protocols on the Internet. This is specified using the
syntax description notation defined in <<RFC2234>>.

[[grammar]]
[source]
----
alphanum       = ALPHA / DIGIT

date-year      = 4DIGIT / ("+" / "-") 6DIGIT
date-month     = 2DIGIT ; 01-12
date-mday      = 2DIGIT ; 01-28, 01-29, 01-30, 01-31 based on month/year
date-full      = date-year "-" date-month "-" date-mday

time-hour      = 2DIGIT ; 00-23
time-minute    = 2DIGIT ; 00-59
time-second    = 2DIGIT ; 00-58, 00-59, 00-60 based on leap second rules
time-secfrac   = "." 1*DIGIT
time-partial   = time-hour ":" time-minute ":" time-second [time-secfrac]
time-numoffset = ("+" / "-") time-partial
time-offset    = "Z" / time-numoffset
time-full      = time-partial time-offset

time-zone-char = ALPHA / "." / "_"
time-zone-part = time-zone-char *13(time-zone-char / DIGIT / "-" / "+") ; but not "." or ".."
time-zone-id   = time-zone-part *("/" time-zone-part)
time-zone      = "[" time-zone-id "]"

namespace      = 1*alphanum
namespace-key  = 1*alphanum
suffix-key     = namespace ["-" namespace-key]

suffix-value   = 1*alphanum
suffix-values  = suffix-value *("-" suffix-value)
suffix-tag     = "[" suffix-key "=" suffix-values "]"
suffix         = [timezone] *suffix-tag

date-time      = date-full "T" time-full suffix
----

NOTE: Per <<RFC2234>> and ISO8601, the "T" and "Z" characters in this
syntax may alternatively be lower case "t" or "z" respectively.

This date/time format may be used in some environments or contexts
that distinguish between the upper- and lower-case letters 'A'-'Z'
and 'a'-'z' (e.g. XML). Specifications that use this format in
such environments MAY further limit the date/time syntax so that
the letters 'T' and 'Z' used in the date/time syntax must always
be upper case. Applications that generate this format SHOULD use
upper case letters.

NOTE: ISO 8601 defines date and time separated by "T".
Applications using this syntax may choose, for the sake of
readability, to specify a full-date and full-time separated by
(say) a space character.

[[restrictions]]
=== Restrictions

The grammar element date-mday represents the day number within the
current month. The maximum value varies based on the month and year
as follows:

.Days in each month
|===
| Month Number  | Month/Year           | Maximum value of date-mday

| 01            | January              | 31
| 02            | February, normal     | 28
| 02            | February, leap year  | 29
| 03            | March                | 31
| 04            | April                | 30
| 05            | May                  | 31
| 06            | June                 | 30
| 07            | July                 | 31
| 08            | August               | 31
| 09            | September            | 30
| 10            | October              | 31
| 11            | November             | 30
| 12            | December             | 31
|===

<<annexB>> contains sample C code to determine if a year is a leap
year.

The grammar element time-second may have the value "60" at the end of
months in which a leap second occurs -- to date: June (XXXX-06-
30T23:59:60Z) or December (XXXX-12-31T23:59:60Z); see <<annexC>> for
a table of leap seconds. It is also possible for a leap second to be
subtracted, at which times the maximum value of time-second is "58".
At all other times the maximum value of time-second is "59".
Further, in time zones other than "Z", the leap second point is
shifted by the zone offset (so it happens at the same instant around
the globe).

Leap seconds cannot be predicted far into the future. The
International Earth Rotation Service publishes bulletins (IERS) that
announce leap seconds with a few weeks' warning. Applications should
not generate timestamps involving inserted leap seconds until after
the leap seconds are announced.

Although ISO 8601 permits the hour to be "24", this extension of a profile
of ISO 8601 only allows values between "00" and "23" for the hour in order
to reduce confusion.

[[date-time-examples]]
=== Examples

Here are some examples of Internet date/time format.

[%unnumbered]
----
1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z
----

This represents 20 minutes and 50.52 seconds after the 23rd hour of
April 12th, 1985 in UTC.

[%unnumbered]
----
+001985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z
----

This represents the same instant as the previous example but with the
expanded 6-digit year format.

[%unnumbered]
----
1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00
----

This represents 39 minutes and 57 seconds after the 16th hour of
December 19th, 1996 with an offset of -08:00 from UTC.
Note that this is equivalent to 1996-12-20T00:39:57Z in UTC.

[%unnumbered]
----
1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00[America/Los_Angeles]
----

This represents the exact same instant as the previous example but
additionally specifies the human time zone associated with it
("Pacific Time") for time-zone-aware implementations to take into account.

[%unnumbered]
----
1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00[America/Los_Angeles][u-ca=hebrew]
----

This represents the exact same instant but it informs calendar-aware
implementations that they should project it to the Hebrew calendar.

[%unnumbered]
----
1990-12-31T23:59:60Z
----

This represents the leap second inserted at the end of 1990.

[%unnumbered]
----
1990-12-31T15:59:60-08:00
----

This represents the same leap second in Pacific Standard Time, 8
hours behind UTC.

[%unnumbered]
----
1937-01-01T12:00:27.87+00:19:32.130
----

This represents the same instant of time as noon, January 1, 1937,
Netherlands time. Standard time in the Netherlands was exactly 19
minutes and 32.13 seconds ahead of UTC by law from 1909-05-01 through
1937-06-30.

[%unnumbered]
----
1937-01-01T12:00:27.87+00:19:32.130[u-ca=gregory]
----

This represents the exact same instant as the previous example but
additionally specifies explicit use of the Gregorian calendar.

[%unnumbered]
----
1937-01-01T12:00:27.87+00:19:32.130[u-ca=islamic-civil]
----

Since there's not a single agreed-upon way to deal with dates in the
Islamic calendar, it provides another value to disambiguate between the
different interpretations.

[%unnumbered]
----
1937-01-01T12:00:27.87+00:19:32.130[x-foo=bar][x-baz=bat]
----

This timestamp utilizes the private use namespace to declare two additional
pieces of information in the suffix that can be interpreted by any
compatible implementations and ignored otherwise.
