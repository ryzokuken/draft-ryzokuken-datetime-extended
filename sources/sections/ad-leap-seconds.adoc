== Leap Seconds

Information about leap seconds can be found at the
https://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/time/master-clock/leap-seconds[US Navy Oceanography Portal].
In particular, it notes that:

[quote]
The decision to introduce a leap second in UTC is the
responsibility of the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS).
According to the CCIR Recommendation, first preference is given to
the opportunities at the end of December and June, and second
preference to those at the end of March and September.

When required, insertion of a leap second occurs as an extra second
at the end of a day in UTC, represented by a timestamp of the form
YYYY-MM-DDT23:59:60Z.  A leap second occurs simultaneously in all
time zones, so that time zone relationships are not affected.  See
section <<date-time-examples>> for some examples of leap second times.

The following table is an excerpt from the table maintained by the
United States Naval Observatory. The source data is located at the
ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/tai-utc.dat[US Navy Oceanography Portal].

This table shows the date of the leap second, and the difference
between the time standard TAI (which isn't adjusted by leap seconds)
and UTC after that leap second.
